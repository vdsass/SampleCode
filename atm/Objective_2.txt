Objective 1:
Write a web-based ATM that provides functionality for credit, debit, statement
generation, and transfer to another account listed from a pull-down menu.

Create another interface for setting up an initial account to enter owner(s)
name(s), initial balance, and a password which will be used to log in to the
ATM; use the crypt() function to store the password and authenticate logins.

Use POD to document your application.
